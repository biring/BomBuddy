Main module for the Electrical BOM (Bill of Materials) Processor.

This module provides the main entry point for interacting with the Electrical BOM
processing system. It includes a menu interface that allows users to select various
options for processing both cBOM and eBOM.

Usage:
    - Run this file to interact with the system. The user will be prompted with a menu
      to select one of the available options for processing the BOMs.

    This function presents a list of options to the user. The user selects an option

    If the user selects an invalid option, a warning message is displayed. In the event
    of an unexpected error, an error message is shown, and the function returns False.
