git branch -a
	Verify new branch is created
git checkout <feature_branch>
	Start working on the new feature
git push origin <feature_branch>
	Pushed new to remote when done

git push origin --delete <feature_branch>

git branch -a
	Verify feature branch is deleted on the remote repo.


SWITCH BRANCH
 - run git log to make sure tracked file changes are commited or discarded
 - git switch does not discard changes to tracked file
git switch [branch-name]
	Switch to the desired branch
	


RESET LOCAL BRANCH TO MATCH REMOTE BRANCH AND DISCARD LOCAL COMMITS
git checkout <your-branch>
	Navigate to the local branch you wish to reset.
git fetch origin
	Fetch the latest data from the remote repository.
OPTIONAL: git stash
	Save the changes you have not yet commited.
git reset --hard origin/<your-branch>
	Reset your branch. Local branch now matches remote branch.
	All commits to local branch are discarded.
git clean -f -d
	Remove untracked files(-f), directories(-d) 

RESET LOCAL BRANCH TO MATCH REMOTE BRANCH BUT PRESERVE LOCAL COMMITS
git checkout <your-branch>
	Navigate to the local branch you wish to reset.
git fetch origin
	Fetch the latest data from the remote repository.
git merge @U
	Merge the changes from the upstream branch (@U) into the current branch


SAVE CHANGES YOU DONT WANT TO COMMIT
git commit -a -m 'message'
	Commit message so you know what you are saving
git branch my-saved-work
	Work is saved in the <branch> in case you want it back


SAVE CHANGES YOU DONT WANT TO COMMIT TO REMOTE

1. DO: git stash
	Save current file/changes in a 'box' to open later
2. DO: git clone <repo-url> <directory.
	Create a copy of your repository. 
	This is back you can get later


DELETE UNTRACKED GIT FILES
Follow these steps to properly delete and git clean untracked files in your local workspace:
git clean -n
	Preview of files that will be deleted.
git clean -f
	Force deletion of untracked files.
git clean -f -d
